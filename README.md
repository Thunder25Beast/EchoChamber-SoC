# Echo Chamber: Final Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and enhancing human-chatbot interactions through advanced NLP-based architectures. Your primary objective is to develop, fine-tune, and deploy a conversational AI system using a pretrained model from Hugging Face.
All the relevant resources used in the project are compiled in this link : [Google Doc link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xsafKt1_r8zz-7S5kEY9RjwKSpGYncJHaXV_ufqiIYU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gv4xpnxb9z7x)

### Files Provided

* **`echo_chamber_final.ipynb`**: The main notebook — includes a working and tested implementation. You can directly upload this to **Google Colab**.
* **`dataset`**: Sample input data folder.
* **`research_paper`**: Baseline paper for comparative study and model understanding.

>  *The current implementation works well. Your task is to push it further.*


### Dataset

The project is based on the **Cornell Movie-Dialogue Corpus**, consisting of:
- `movie_lines.txt`
- `movie_conversations.txt`
>  *This dataset offers a rich and diverse set of dialogue pairs drawn from a variety of movie scripts, ideal for training and evaluating dialogue systems.*

##  Your Final Objectives

1. **Understand** the implementation in `echo_chamber_final.ipynb`.
2. **Study** all the important NLP/ML concepts and terms mentioned.
3. **Fine-tune / modify** the model — this could include:

   * Trying new feature engineering techniques
   * Replacing base models with better architectures
   * Tuning hyperparameters
   * Experimenting with training/validation splits

4. **Write a final report** (to be submitted separately):

   * Explain all important keywords in your final code
   * List of changes made
   * Final model architecture
   * Results table comparing original and your improved model
   * Your learnings

## What’s Next?

 After completing the analysis and comparison, we will proceed to deploy the best version of your model using **Streamlit**.

 **Deployment Instructions + Final Date will be shared soon**. Stay tuned

##  Contribution Etiquette

* Keep your changes modular — use functions or additional cells.
* Comment generously, especially for new logic.
* Push your changes via PRs and mention what you changed + why.

---
## General Instructions
* It is not compulsory to train the model on new dataset, tuning existing model is perfectly alright
* You have been provided with **`echo_chamber_final.ipynb`** which already contain for data loading, sampling and tokenising
* To get an idea about how to use the existing model directly, a snippet at the end of file is given to get an idea
* We expect you to learn and implement your learnings, document your results, even bad too, those are the stepping stones that will come along the journey
* If you guys ever feel stuck, reach any of us out :)

Happy Learning!!!
